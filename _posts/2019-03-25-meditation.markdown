I don’t like meditating. But when I do it regularly, life is better. Stress is lower. My health improves. Problems seem smaller. I seem bigger.


- As much as I’m loath to admit it, I’m not a fan of meditation. It comes unnaturally to me, despite my 36 years of martial arts study and interest in self-improvement, health-hacking, and general enlightenment.

- I realize this speaks poorly of me as a person, kind of like my opinions on aikido, jazz music, pumpkin pie, and “A Prairie Home Companion.” That I’m not fond of them doesn’t mean they’re bad, it means I’m not as good as I could be.

- Worse yet, when I do regularly meditate, I find my life is better. Stress is lower, my health improves. I can focus more on my work, and am less likely to say things I regret to my friends, colleagues, and loved ones. Problems seem smaller. I seem bigger.

- And I’m not alone. Over the past few decades, a host of researchTrusted Source has supported the conclusion that meditation is good for us, and that we should all meditate a few minutes each day.
